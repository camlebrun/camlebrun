   Hello! I'm Camille, an Analytics Engineer at Lucky Cart. I specialize in building robust data models, ensuring data quality, automating workflows, and leveraging data science to enhance our products.<br><br>
   
   One of my core competencies is working with **dbt (Data Build Tool)**, where I focus on transforming raw data into insightful, actionable data models. By applying best practices in data engineering, I help ensure that our data pipelines are both scalable and reliable. My work with dbt includes creating reusable data models, optimizing SQL queries, and implementing rigorous testing to maintain data integrity across our analytics environment.<br><br>
   
   In addition to data modeling, I am deeply involved in **data transformation processes** that drive business decisions. I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code that aligns with our team's goals and the broader company's objectives. By transforming complex data into meaningful insights, I help the team make data-driven decisions that improve the product and customer experience.<br><br>
   
   I'm a dedicated advocate for ethical data analysis and AI, committed to promoting human-centric data practices and responsible technology. My journey involves exploring the intersections of data analysis, artificial intelligence, and occasionally biochemistry.<br><br>
   
   I believe in the importance of code quality, which is why I've recently removed some repositories that no longer met my standards. Quality over quantity is my mantra.
