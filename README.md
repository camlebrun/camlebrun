   Hello, I'm Camille, a dedicated advocate for ethical Data Analysis & AI, promoting human-centric data practices and responsible technology. My journey involves exploring the intersections of data analysis and artificial intelligence (sometimes biochemistry). <br> I believe in the importance of code quality and have recently deleted some repositories that no longer met my standards.
