Camille Lebrun | Analytics Engineer

Hello! I’m Camille Lebrun, an Analytics Engineer dedicated to transforming raw data into scalable and efficient data models. With two years of experience in data modeling and ensuring data quality, I’ve developed strong expertise in dbt and SQL, complemented by Python for data science tasks, including natural language processing (NLP) and AI-driven models.

**Skills and Expertise**

I leverage modern data stacks, including Google BigQuery, Snowflake, dbt, and Metabase, to deliver end-to-end solutions and automate processes. Using tools like Tableau and Power BI, I create interactive dashboards that empower data-driven decision-making.

**My Path and Goals**

While my GitHub doesn’t yet fully showcase my capabilities as an Analytics Engineer, I’m actively working on projects that will reflect my skills. My goal is to soon share these projects, providing a concrete glimpse of my expertise in modern data engineering and analytics.

**Inclusion and Diversity**
As a non-binary professional, I am committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. I believe that innovation thrives through diverse perspectives.
