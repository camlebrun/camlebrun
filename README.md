## 👤 About Me

As an **Analytics Engineer with 3+ years of experience**, I specialize in building robust data solutions that deliver measurable business value. My core expertise lies in **dbt** for data modeling and transformation, combined with advanced orchestration using **Kestra** and **Airflow**, and reliable data ingestion with **Airbyte** to automate and scale complex, end-to-end workflows.

I have hands-on experience across the modern data stack, from cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) to ingestion pipelines with Airbyte (batch and CDC) and transformation with dbt (Core/Cloud), orchestrated through Kestra and Airflow. I excel at designing end-to-end data solutions that empower stakeholders to make confident, data-driven decisions.

### Automated Tech Watch System

**Challenge:**  
Manual tech watch process was time-consuming and inefficient. Needed to aggregate content from multiple sources (Medium emails, RSS feeds) and transform it into actionable insights. Required an automated solution leveraging modern data stack technologies.

**Solution:**  
- Extract Medium articles from email with Python → stored as JSON
- Process RSS feeds (XML) through automated Python scripts
- Orchestration and transformations with dbt
- Data ingestion from GCP to BigQuery using dlt
- Deployment with Cloud Functions, Cloud Build, and Cloud Run
- Infrastructure managed with Terraform

**Impact:**  
- Fully automated tech watch process eliminating manual work
- Centralized data collection enabling comprehensive content analysis
- Foundation for future AI-powered features: LLM summarization and AI agent for intelligent content discovery
- Personal project demonstrating end-to-end data engineering capabilities
